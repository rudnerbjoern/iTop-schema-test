# Combined XSD Schemas for iTop

This directory contains **automatically generated** XSD files for the [iTop CMDB system](https://www.combodo.com/itop).

## ⚠️ Do not edit manually

All files in this folder are **generated by an automated workflow**.
Manual changes will be overwritten on every commit to the `main` branch.

## 📦 Purpose

These files are intended for **external use**:

- You can download and include them in your own iTop-related projects
- Each file is self-contained – all referenced definitions via `xs:include` are already merged
- They are validated and formatted as part of the CI pipeline
